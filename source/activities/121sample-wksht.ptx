                    This activity asks students to describe the effect of different affine transformation of functions after experimenting with Desmos. The pre-built Desmos graph appears in the html version while a QR code is created in the print version.

                    Obviously, interactive elements don't work very well in printed worksheets. When you print a worksheet you can have it include a static screenshot of the given interactive as well as a QR code to the interactive (still within your pretext book). To do this, you need to edit the file <c>publication-standalone.ptx</c>. In this file, find the <c> html </c> section and edit the <c>baseurl</c> entry to be the url of your deployed Pretext project with <c>/worksheets</c> at the end.
                </p>

                    The ability to print directly from html versions of worksheets isn't great. Hence, if you want to hand out worksheets in class, you will need to do the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Uncomment the <c>pretext</c> and <c>article</c> tags at the top and bottom of the worksheet's ptx file.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    <li>
                    <p>
                    Run the command <c>pretext build  pdf -i ./source/activities/121samplewksht.ptx</c> (change file name to your worksheet) to generate a pdf version and print the worksheet you want.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>    
                Now your worksheet will appear in <c>output/pdfs</c>.

                </p>
