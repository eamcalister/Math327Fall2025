            <title>Modeling Activity 2 (Part 2) - Numerical Approach to the Fastball Model with Insightmaker</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Now we will use additional data to refine our estimate of the parameter <m>k</m> from <xref ref="Fastpitch_Formulas"/>. To start we will discuss building a similar model and parameter estimation with Insightmaker using <url href="https://eamcalister.github.io/InsightmakerODEModeling/SprintModel.html" visual="sprint model estimation" />. In particular, we will find <url href="https://insightmaker.com/insight/58F5qZ0Fmgj8xhsumaE6WC" visual="this Insight" /> useful.

                    <em> This activity is to be done with a partner and is due Saturday, September 13 on Canvas.</em> Please make sure your final write-up is in ``final draft'' form.

        Create an Insight to estimate <m>k</m> for each row of the table given below. You must include your Insightmaker file as an attachemnt to your write-up. Use your collection of values to create a final estimate of <m>k</m>. <term>Note:</term> There is some bad data in the table; you need to recognize it.

		Aroldis Chapman's fastest recorded pitch was a 105.1 mph fastball on September 24, 2010, and its velocity was measured 50.5 ft from home plate. Nolan Ryan threw a pitch whose velocity was measured at 100.9 mph at a distance of 10 ft from home plate. Use your Insight and estimate(s) of <m>k</m> to decide which of these two pitches was likely the fastest.
