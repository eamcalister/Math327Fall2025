            <title>Modeling Activity 2 (Part 1) - Analytic Approach to the Fastball Model</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                   Pitch velocity is one of the most fascinating statistics in baseball, as documented in the 2015 documentary <em>Fastball</em>(<url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ogJvlzwxQs" visual="on Youtube" />). The interesting thing is that methods of measurement have changed over the years. Curently, the velocity is measured as is leaves the pitcher's hand. From 2008 through 2016, the velocity was measured at a distance of <m>50.5</m> feet from home plate. When a radar gun was first used in a Major League game in 1974, the measurement of velocity was take <m>10</m> feet from home plate. Since pitches slow down as they travel, we would like to develop an ODE model for pitch velocity to compare some of the fastest pitches ever thrown.

		Define variables as follows:

			<li>
				<p>
					Use dimensional analysis to explain why the exponent <m>c</m> must equal <m>2</m>.

  <p>
	From now on, we may represent the ODE given in <xref ref="baseball_dimensional_model"/> as

<introduction>
    <p>
        We would like to estimate the value of the parameter <m>k</m> using the formula for <m>s(t)</m> from <xref ref="analytic_solution"/> from data from a single pitch collected with a Bluetooth enabled baseball (<url href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csJmCHzopbc_EWa1idFGMoDUBorkBRIbZvatA2nk11U/edit?gid=2134910657#gid=2134910657" visual = "Pitch Data"/>). The data collected consists of the following:
        	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				<term>Time to Plate:</term> This is the time it takes from the pitcher's initial movement until the ball gets to home plate, which is 60.5 feet from the pitcher's mound.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<term>Delivery Time:</term> This is the time from the pitcher's initial movement until the ball is released.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<term>Extension:</term> This is how far in front of the pitcher's mound the ball is released.
			</p>
		</li>

<task workspace="6in">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Use the formulas for <m>s(t)</m> and <m>v(t)</m> you got in <xref ref="analytic_solution"/> and the single pitch data in <xref ref="pitch_data"/> and try to solve for <m>k</m> algebraically. Say where you get stuck. (Be careful with your units.)

<task workspace="2in">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Now use some graphing technology to estimate <m>k</m> using the given data and your formula from <xref ref="analytic_solution"/>. <em>You must include a screenshot of your graph in your write-up</em>. <term>Note:</term> The value of <m>k</m> is pretty small.
        </p>
    </statement>
</task>
    
</exercise>
<p>
    The estimate of <m>k</m> you just found was based on a single pitch and might be inexact. On Wednesday we will use more data and Insightmaker to refine our estimate of <m>k</m>. Then we will have enough information to answer who threw the fastest pitch ever.
