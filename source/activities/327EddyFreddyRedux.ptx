                In this activity we will revistit our cycist friends, Eddy and Freddy. Now that we know some more differential equations, we will do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Figure out precisely why Eddy and Freddy always settled down on an equilibrium velocity and why oscillations ceased if <m>k_2 &lt; 0.25</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Use Insightmaker find the resonant frequency when Freddy forces an oscillation.

                        Recall the Eddy and Freddy cycling scenario. Eddy was a jerk who always wanted to be <m>0.5</m> meters ahead of Freddy, who just wanted to ride the same speed as Eddy. For this scenario we derived the system of ODEs:
<me>
\fourvec{x_1'}{x_2'}{v_1'}{v_2'} = \left[\begin{array}{r r r r} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -k_1 &amp; k_1\\ k_2 &amp; -k_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{array}\right]\fourvec{x_1}{x_2}{v_1}{v_2} + \fourvec{0}{0}{0}{0.5k_2}.
</me>

Here we are using <m>x_1</m> and <m>v_1</m> to represent the position and velocities of Freddy and <m>x_2</m> and <m>v_2</m> to represent the position and velocity of Eddy. The constants <m>k_1</m> and <m>k_2</m> are assumed to be positive.

                            (4 points) Let <m>x = x_2-x_1-0.5</m>. Use the above system of differential equations to show that <m>x</m> satisfies the second-order ODE

                                x'' +k_2 x' + k_1x = 0.

                            (3 points) Use second-order the ODE given above to explain why Eddy and Freddy always settled down to a constant velocity with Eddy exactly <m>0.5</m> meters ahead of Freddy.

                        After constant ridicule from his friends over his half-wheeling, Eddy got some therapy to counteract his hyper-competitive nature. Now he wants to ride side-by-side with Freddy. However, Freddy now chooses to apply an oscillatory force while he rides (using a hidden motor). Letting <m>x</m> denote the distance between Eddy and Freddy, we now have a second order ODE 
                        <me>
                            x'' + x' + 3x = \cos(\omega t),
                        </me>
                        where Freddy can modify <m>\omega</m>.
                    </p>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    (6 points) Develop an Insight for this differential equation with a slider for <m>\omega</m>. Because this is a second-order equation, there should be two stocks. Assume that Eddy and Freddy are initially side-by-side and going the same velocity (<m>x(0) = 0</m> and <m>x'(0) = 0</m>). Using the slider, get a rough estimate range of values of <m>\omega</m> that maximize the amplitude of the steady-state oscillation. (<em>You must turn in an Insightmaker file.</em>)

                <p>
                    (4 points) Introduce a new variable for the steady-state amplitude and give it the formula <c>PastMax([x])</c>. By running the simulation with both <m>x</m> and this new variable plotted, explain why this represents the amplitude of the steady-state for reasonable values of <m>\omega</m>.

                <p>
                    (4 points) Use the optimizer to maximize the final value of variable from the last. Use a range of values for the upper and lower bounds in the optimizer from part (a). Your optimal value of <m>\omega</m> should roughly coincide with the number <m>\omega_{res}</m> found in equation 4.4.12 in section 4.4 of the course textbook. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    (This value of <m>\omega </m> maximizes the amplitude of oscillations in the distance between Eddy and Freddy. Freddy knows this agitates Eddy, so he finds this to be the optimal value of <m>\omega</m>.)
