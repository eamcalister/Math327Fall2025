        <p>
            Suppose we have a first-order IVP known to be of the form

            where <m>f(t)</m> is a function we can change. If the response of this system for the input
            <me>
                f(t) = h(t)

        <p>
            Suppose we have a second-order IVP known to be of the form
            <me>
                ay'' + by' + cy = f(t),\ y(0)=y'(0)=0,
            </me>
            where <m>f(t)</m> is a function we can change. The impulse response (i.e. <m>f(t) = \delta(t)</m>) of this system
            is <me>y(t) = 4te^{-0.5t}</me>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Find the system transfer function for this system (i.e. the Laplace transform of the impulse response).

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Use the system transfer function to find the response of the system if the input is <m>h(t)-h(t-1)</m>. Give your answer both in terms of Heaviside functions and as a piecewise defined function.

<exercise>
<statement>
    <p>
        A <m>100</m> liter tank initially contains only pure water. At time zero a brine solution containing <m>0.1</m> kg of salt per liter of water starts flowing in at a rate of <m>2</m> liters per minute. A well-stirred mixture flows out at <m>2</m> liters per minute. After <m>10</m> seconds an unknown quantity, <m>A</m>, of salt is accidentally dumped into the tank (it dissolves and mixes instantaneously). The concentration of the outflow is monitored and is given by 
        <me>
            c(t) = 0.1 + 0.195e^{-0.02t}
        </me>
        after the salt was dumped into the tank (note, the concentration in the tank is the mass of salt in the tank divided by the volume of the tank and <m>t</m> is still the time after the mixing process started). How much salt was accidentally dumped into the tank? <em>Hint:</em> Set up and solve an IVP involving a <m>\delta</m> function with the parameter <m>A</m>, then match with the given concentration.
