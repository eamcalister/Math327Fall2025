    <title>Basic Needs Statement</title>
    <p>
      The Grub Hub cares about your personal and academic success. We recognize that it can be hard to focus in class when you have trouble affording enough food to eat, do not have a safe and reliable place to sleep, and/or experiencing an emergency or crisis. The Grub Hub offers several services for accessing basic needs. Join us for daily hot meals and a pantry full of free food, hygiene items, menstruation products, and more. We also offer financial assistance for housing insecurity and resource navigation for public benefits that students are eligible for, such as Medicaid and SNAP (a free federal food assistance program that can provide up to $250/month for groceries). We are located in the Student Union, across from the Post Office, and open Monday-Friday, 10am-5pm. Contact Stella Zhu, the Basic Needs Coordinator (mzhu@fortlewis.edu), if you have questions or need assistance. The Grub Hub is here to support you.

    <title>Students as Parents Statement</title>
    <p>
      We are aware that it can be challenging to be a parent while enrolled in college courses and we work to support parents to be successful in this work.  If you are unable to attend class due to children's illnesses or unforeseen disruptions in childcare, please contact your instructor individually so we can make an alternate plan to help you meet the course outcomes.  We are also happy to speak with you about some strategies that have helped parents in our courses to be successful in balancing home/school responsibilities.
