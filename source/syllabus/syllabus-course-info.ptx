    <title>Course Description</title>
    <p>
      An introduction to ordinary differential equations. Topics include methods of solving first-order ordinary differential equations, basic theory of solving n-th order linear equations, solving linear systems of first order equations, and Laplace transforms. Other topics may include numerical methods, infinite series methods, and qualitative analysis of differential equations. Applications will be emphasized.

    <p>
      If you need to miss class, that is ok. If you miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.

    <title>Technology and Software Requirements</title>
    <p>
      You will need to be able to access Canvas and Webwork (online homework system) and submit assignments online. Internet access and a scanning device are required. Calculators will not be used on exams, but will frequently be useful for homework and in class.
