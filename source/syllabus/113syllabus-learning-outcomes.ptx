        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students master skills of recognizing, manipulating, representing and solving equations as they apply to the linear, quadratic, and power families of functions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students develop proficiency in the skills of recognizing, manipulating, representing, and solving equations as they apply to the exponential and logarithmic families of functions.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students recognize when a certain type of function (linear, quadratic, power, exponential or logarithmic) is or is not the appropriate choice to mathematically model a physical application, and apply the selected model.

    <p>This course meets the following gtPathway Student Learning Outcomes: Quantitative Literacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Competency in quantitative literacy represents a student's ability to use quantifiable information and mathematical analysis to make connections and draw conclusions. Students with strong quantitative literacy skills understand and can create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc.).
