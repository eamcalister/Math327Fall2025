    <p>This course meets the following gtPathway Student Learning Outcomes: Quantitative Literacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Competency in quantitative literacy represents a studentâ€™s ability to use quantifiable information and mathematical analysis to make connections and draw conclusions. Students with strong quantitative literacy skills understand and can create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc.).
