    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Recognize when to use algebra and perform algebra correctly. Mathematics is a cumulative subject. You must correctly use the skills acquired in previous math classes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Understand and correctly use notation. Mathematics is a very precise science. You must think clearly and precisely about Calculus and using correct notation will help you do this. Also, while the final answer is certainly important, it is more important to be able to communicate your ideas. You must use correct notation to be able to do this.

    <p>This course meets the following gtPathway Student Learning Outcomes: Quantitative Literacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Competency in quantitative literacy represents a student's ability to use quantifiable information and mathematical analysis to make connections and draw conclusions. Students with strong quantitative literacy skills understand and can create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc.).
