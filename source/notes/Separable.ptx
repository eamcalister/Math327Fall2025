            <title>The Separation of Variables Method</title>
        <p>
            The following method can be used to solve separable ODEs, at least in principle. The ability to perform the necessary integrations and/or do algebra for an explicit expression for <m>u(t)</m> will always be an issue (they're not always possible).  
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Note:</alert> Separation of variables also refers to an important technique for solving partial differential equations using Fourier series. This isn't what we're doing.

            <title>Solving with an Integrating Factor</title>
            <p>
                To solve <xref ref="first_sep"/>, proceed as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Separate:
                            <me>
                                \frac{1}{h(u)}du = g(t)dt
                            </me>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           Integrate:
                            <me>
                                \int\frac{1}{h(u)}du = \int g(t)dt
                            </me>
                        Observe that you are really doing a "<m>u</m>" substitution on the left-hand side. The integral is really with respect to <m>t</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This will get you an equation of the form
                            <me>
                                F(u) = G(t) + C,
                            </me>
                            where <m>G(t)</m> is some antiderivative of <m>g(t)</m> and <m>F(u)</m> is an antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{F(u)}</m>.
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           Do algebra to solve for <m>u(t)</m> and/or apply initial conditions to determine <m>C</m>. At this point the technique depends on that specific functions you're dealing with.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
