            <title>The Integrating Factor Method</title>
        <p>
            The following method will always work to find solutions to linear first-order ODEs. The only potential problem with it is finding antiderivatives. Because of the name of the function <m>\mu(t)</m> in this method, it is called the <term>integrating factor method</term>.

            <title>Solving with an Integrating Factor</title>
            <p>
                To solve <xref ref="first_non_hom"/>, proceed as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Re-write the equation in the form
                            <me>
                                u' - h(t)u  = g(t).
                            </me>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Compute the integrating factor
                            <me>
                                \mu(t) = e^{-\int h(t)dt}
                            </me>
                            (the integral in the exponent can me taken with constant of integration equal to zero). Observe that <m>\mu'(t) = -h(t)\mu(t) </m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Multiply both sides of the re-written ODE by <m>\mu(t)</m> to obtain
                            <me>
                                u'\mu(t) - h(t)\mu(t)u(t) = g(t)\mu(t).
                            </me>
                            Note that, by the observation in the previous step, the left-hand side of this equation is
                            <me>
                                \frac{d}{dt}(u\cdot \mu(t)).
                            </me>
                            Thus, the ODE takes the form
                            <me>
                                \frac{d}{dt}(u\cdot \mu(t)) = g(t)\mu(t).

                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Integrate both sides of the last equation to get rid of the <m>\frac{d}{dt}</m>, then solve for <m>u(t)</m>. Apply whatever initial conditions you may have to solve for the unknown constant in your solution.

          <title>The <m>u_p + u_h</m> Method</title>
        <p>
            Another useful, but less flexible, method relies on the following theorem.

        <theorem xml:id="first-order-linear-solutions">
            <title>Form of Solutions to First-Order Linear ODEs</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    The general solution to the ODE <xref ref="first_non_hom"/> is
                <me>
                    u(t) = u_h(t) + u_p(t)
                </me>
                where <m>u_h(t)</m> is the general solution to the homogeneous first-order ODE
                <men xml:id="hom_aux" >
                    u' = h(t)u
                </men>
                and <m>u_p(t)</m> is any particular solution to <xref ref="first_non_hom"/> you may be able to find.                                
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>u(t)</m> be an arbitrary solution to <xref ref="first_non_hom"/>. Consider the difference <m>u(t) - u_p(t)</m>. Observe that
                <md>
                    <mrow> \frac{d}{dt}(u(t)-u_p(t)) \amp = (g(t) + h(t)u(t)) - (g(t) + h(t)u_p(t)) </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp =  h(t)(u(t) - u_p(t)).  </mrow> 
                </md>
                Hence, <m>u(t) - u_p(t)</m> is a solution to <xref ref="hom_aux"/>, which means <m>u(t)</m> has the form indicated by the theorem.

                    <p>
                        Observe that <m>u_h(t) = Ke^{\int h(t) dt}</m>, where <m>K</m> is an arbitrary constant.

        <remark>
            <statement>
                <p>
                The technique <xref ref="u_p-u_h-method"/> is extremely useful when a particular solution can be found by inspection. For instance, when an equilibrium or steady-state solution is evident.
