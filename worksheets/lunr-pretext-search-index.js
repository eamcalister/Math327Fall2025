  "body": " Modeling Activity 1 - Introduction to Insightmaker    This activity is to be done with a partner and is due Tuesday, September 2 on Canvas. Please make sure your final write-up is in ``final draft'' form. If you haven't already done this, go to and create an account. We will use this site (and other software) throughout the semester. You may also want to go to prior to class to help you figure out what is happening.      (The Mystery Insight) Go to and clone this Insight.     (2 points) When you click Simulate, what function is graphed?      (3 points) Change the initial value on the What am I? stock to something other than zero. Now what function is graphed when you simulate?      (3 points) Now click on the inflow = f flow into\/out of the stock. Based on the formula for this flow, what is the stock in relation to the flow? Tell me why this makes sense in terms of Calculus, and ``prove'' your answer by changing the flow function and showing the resulting simulation graph.      (2 points) What is the Mystery Insight model, expressed as a differential equation?       (5 points) (Build Your Own, Simple version) Now we would like to create an Insight to model Malthusian growth, i.e. exponential growth of a population given by the differential equation. We're going to do this together. When you submit your work, include the Insightmaker file (with a name different from the one on problem 3).  Here are some steps we'll take:   Create a primitive Stock, and call it , or whatever you think sounds good. Assign units to this stock.    We want to create a model in which we can vary the parameter . To do this, create a primitive Variable called . For this, you can create a slider so that you don't have to manually type in values. Also, give a reasonable range of values with a reasonable step-size.    Create a flow off of you stock. In order to have the flow rate involve the parameter , you need a link from to the flow. Create that, then give the formula for the flow.   Now simulate and see if the graph you get is what you expect. If it isn't we'll figure out what's wrong.        Now create an Insight to for the fish population with harvesting given in section 1.3 of the text (the differential equation is equation 1.3.6 in html version). Your Insight should have three parameters , , and . It should have two flows, one inflow for reproduction (involving ) and one outflow to account for resource limitations and harvesting (involving and ). Again, include the Insightmaker file for this exercise. To receive full credit all primitives should have units.    Sense making tip: Do a little algebra to get the differential equation to have isolated parts with obvious 's and 's and use in arrows for 's and out arrows for 's. Also, to receive full credit, your Insight must include units for all stocks, flows, and variables.     (5 points) Let , , , and . Run the simulation. Does the solution curve make sense, given the context of the model (What are and supposed to represent?)? Also, does the graph you get from Insightmaker approximately agree with the solution given by equation 1.3.7 (in html version insider reading exercise 1.3.8) of the text (using the given parameters, graphed somewhere else, like Desmos)? Include screenshots of all your images in your submission and write sentences to explain.      (5 points) By varying values of (with the other parameters as above), how large can be before the fish population goes extinct eventually? Include screenshots in your write-up to support your claim.      "

  "title": "Modeling Activity 2 (Part 1) - Analytic Approach to the Fastball Model",
  "body": " Modeling Activity 2 (Part 1) - Analytic Approach to the Fastball Model   Pitch velocity is one of the most fascinating statistics in baseball, as documented in the 2015 documentary Fastball ( ). The interesting thing is that methods of measurement have changed over the years. Curently, the velocity is measured as is leaves the pitcher's hand. From 2008 through 2016, the velocity was measured at a distance of feet from home plate. When a radar gun was first used in a Major League game in 1974, the measurement of velocity was take feet from home plate. Since pitches slow down as they travel, we would like to develop an ODE model for pitch velocity to compare some of the fastest pitches ever thrown.   This activity is to be done with a partner and is due Friday, September 12 on Canvas. Please make sure your final write-up is in ``final draft'' form.      Define variables as follows: Assume that the force acting to slow down a baseball in flight is given by    Use dimensional analysis to explain why the exponent must equal .    Explain why it makes sense to have the minus sign in front of .       Attach units to all the terms on both sides of the given equation and observe that time units only appear in one place on the right-hand side.    From now on, we may represent the ODE given in as where .      Solve the ODE given above for and integrate to get the displacement function .        We would like to estimate the value of the parameter using the formula for from from data from a single pitch collected with a Bluetooth enabled baseball ( ). The data collected consists of the following:    Time to Plate: This is the time it takes from the pitcher's initial movement until the ball gets to home plate, which is 60.5 feet from the pitcher's mound.     Delivery Time: This is the time from the pitcher's initial movement until the ball is released.     Extension: This is how far in front of the pitcher's mound the ball is released.     Baseball Velocity Data    Initial Velocity (mph) Time to Plate (s) Delivery Time (s) Extension (ft)    85 1.2 0.74 5.1        Use the formula for you got in and the single pitch data in and try to solve for algebraically. Say where you get stuck.      Now use some graphing technology to estimate using the given data and your formula from . You must include a screenshot of your graph in your write-up .     The estimate of you just found was based on a single pitch and might be inexact. On Wednesday we will use more data and Insightmaker to refine our estimate of . Then we will have enough information to answer who threw the fastest pitch ever.   "
