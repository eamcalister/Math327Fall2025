  "body": " Modeling Activity 2 (Part 1) - Analytic Approach to the Fastball Model   Pitch velocity is one of the most fascinating statistics in baseball, as documented in the 2015 documentary Fastball ( ). The interesting thing is that methods of measurement have changed over the years. Curently, the velocity is measured as is leaves the pitcher's hand. From 2008 through 2016, the velocity was measured at a distance of feet from home plate. When a radar gun was first used in a Major League game in 1974, the measurement of velocity was take feet from home plate. Since pitches slow down as they travel, we would like to develop an ODE model for pitch velocity to compare some of the fastest pitches ever thrown.   This activity is to be done with a partner and is due Friday, September 12 on Canvas. Please make sure your final write-up is in ``final draft'' form.      Define variables as follows: Assume that the force acting to slow down a baseball in flight is given by    Use dimensional analysis to explain why the exponent must equal .    Explain why it makes sense to have the minus sign in front of .       Attach units to all the terms on both sides of the given equation and observe that time units only appear in one place on the right-hand side.    From now on, we may represent the ODE given in as where .      Solve the ODE given above for and integrate to get the displacement function .        We would like to estimate the value of the parameter using the formula for from from data from a single pitch collected with a Bluetooth enabled baseball ( ). The data collected consists of the following:    Time to Plate: This is the time it takes from the pitcher's initial movement until the ball gets to home plate, which is 60.5 feet from the pitcher's mound.     Delivery Time: This is the time from the pitcher's initial movement until the ball is released.     Extension: This is how far in front of the pitcher's mound the ball is released.

You must include a screenshot of your graph in your write-up . Note: The value of is pretty small.     The estimate of you just found was based on a single pitch and might be inexact.

Use Insightmaker find the resonant frequency when Freddy forces an oscillation.     Be sure to answer every question and include any graphs you use to make your assertions.         Recall the Eddy and Freddy cycling scenario. Eddy was a jerk who always wanted to be meters ahead of Freddy, who just wanted to ride the same speed as Eddy. For this scenario we derived the system of ODEs: Here we are using and to represent the position and velocities of Freddy and and to represent the position and velocity of Eddy. The constants and are assumed to be positive.     (4 points) Let .
