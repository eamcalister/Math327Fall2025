Topics include methods of solving first-order ordinary differential equations, basic theory of solving n-th order linear equations, solving linear systems of first order equations, and Laplace transforms. Other topics may include numerical methods, infinite series methods, and qualitative analysis of differential equations. Applications will be emphasized.    Instructional Format  This is a face-to-face course, which means we will meet in person.    Course Materials  Required Text: Differential Equations: A Toolbox for Modeling the World , by Kurt Brian (ISBN 979-8-89372-019-8). Purchasing the textbook is officially optional, but strongly encouraged. The first chapter is available online at and the text is available for purchase at or .  In addition to the textbook we will use some Python and the online modeling software Insightmaker ( .)    Student Office Hours      Erich's PEC Office Hours: MWF 1:30-2:30 pm     Other Office Hours: If you are unable to attend my PEC hours, but still need some help, please let me know and we can find a time that will work.       Feedback and Communication  Communication of all course information will occur via Canvas as well as in class. Most assignments will be submitted and graded online in Canvas or Webwork.     Missing Class  If you need to miss class, that is ok. If you miss class, be sure to check Canvas for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.  If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.    Technology and Software Requirements  You will need to be able to access Canvas and Webwork (online homework system) and submit assignments online. Internet access and a scanning device are required. Calculators will not be used on exams, but will frequently be useful for homework and in class.       Learning Outcomes    Basic Concepts in Differential Equations  Students will learn basic concepts in differential equations. These include:   Students will know what a differential equation is and what it means to solve one.    Students will know basic differential equation nomenclature (order, linearity, etc.).    Students will know what is meant by analytic, numerical, and qualitiative techniques for differential equations.       Analytic Solution Methods  Students will become proficient with the following analytic techniques for solving ordinary differential equations:   solving first-order linear ODEs using integrating factors,    solving separable first-order ODEs using the method of Separation of Variables,    solving linear systems of differential equations using the eigenvalue method,    and solving linear constant-coefficient second-order ODEs using eigenvalues, undetermined coefficients, and the Laplace transform.       Qualitiative and Numerical Methods  Students will learn the basic ideas of numerical and qualitiative methods. These include the following:   sketching direction fields for first-order ODEs,    sketching phase portraits for autonomous first-order ODEs,    finding bifurcation values for parametrized families of autonomous first-order ODEs,    understand and execute Euler's Method both by hand and with a computer,    and estimate appropriate step-sizes for Euler's Method based on the order of the method.       Mathematical Modeling with Differential Equations  Students will build and analyze mathematical models of real-world scenarios using differential equations.      Course Requirements and Grading   Final grades will be determined using the following assignment categories (descriptions below):    Assignment Category  Weight    Homework (Online and Written System)  25%    Modeling Activities  10%    Three Midterm Exams  15% each    Cumulative Final Exam  20%    Grading Scale    Letter Grade Point Range ( )    A    A-    B+    B    B-    C+    C    C-    D+    D    D-    F     Homework  Webwork is our online homework system. An account has been created for you and a link posted on Canvas. You should check Webwork every class day for new assignments. Their due dates are posted with the assignment. Typically, Webwork assignments will be due at 11:59pm two business days after that section's material has been completed in class. Thus, we have the following:    Day Day Due    Monday Wednesday    Wednesday Friday    Friday Tuesday    After the due date there will be a reduced credit period of 48 hours for each Webwork assignment in which you can receive 75% credit on all work completed.  Because online homework tells you if your answer is right or wrong as soon as you submit it, and for most questions you will be allowed multiple submissions, doing online homework may take you longer than doing written homework. So, give yourself plenty of time by starting your homework ASAP after it is assigned. This will give you time to do the assignment and get help if you need it.   Note: For topics that don't lend themselves well to online homework, there will also be standard homework assignments (graded by your professor).    Modeling Activities  The entire reason for studying differential equations is that they are useful for modeling the real world. Throughout the semester, there will be several modeling activities to both motivate and review topics.    Midterm Exams  There will be three midterm exams given in class on 9\/15, 10\/20, and 11\/17. The class day before exams will be reserved for review.    Cumulative Final Exam  Your cumulative final exam will be Monday, December 8, from 9:45-11:45am.      Course Expectations   Save Your Spot  Stay enrolled in this and your other courses this term by attending class and participating in required course activities during the first week of the term. Instructors have the option to disenroll a student from a class if the student has missed at least one scheduled class in person or via Zoom or required online course activity for online courses (check your syllabus for information) during the first 4 days of the week in which the course is scheduled to meet for the first time. This allows students who are on the course waitlist to be added to the course.    Course Workload and Time Management  How can you create a weekly schedule based on your courses and study time needed for success? As long as you know the number of credit hours you are taking, it’s easy! In a face-to-face class, one course credit is the same as one hour of lecture per week for a 15-week term. Additionally, you need to plan for a minimum of two more hours of preparation for each credit hour (and that's according to the federal definition of a credit hour). Thus, in this face-to-face 3-credit course we will meet in person for 3 hours per week, and you should plan on a minimum average of 6 hours per week of homework, reading, and preparation outside of class. Some weeks it may be less; some weeks it may be more. This weekly amount of homework and preparation time will typically vary based on a number of factors about you as a learner and student. Please let me know if you fall behind or need any help figuring out your weekly schedule and meeting these course workload expectations.    Diversity and Inclusive Classroom Statements  Each member of this class is responsible for contributing to and maintaining an atmosphere of respect for all other members. This means each of us is responsible for ensuring that:    All perspectives and experiences are respected.    Class discussions and individual comments are respectful and do not degrade, stereotype, or promote deficit thinking about any group or individual.    Each person in the class has an opportunity to articulate their perspective and ideas without being demeaned.    Students who demonstrate a disregard for this responsibility will be alerted that their attitudes and\/or actions inhibit a respectful and safe learning environment. The instructor reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action.      Email and Netiquitte  “Netiquette” is a protocol for interacting and behaving online. Although digital interactions are not face-to-face, they affect real people; thus, we must be sensitive to the fact that our words impact others. The following are an outline of ways that you can communicate professionally and sensitively online:    Be sensitive to others' cultural, social, political and linguistic backgrounds. Everyone is different and unique. Remember to show respect for our differences.    Incorporate professionalism and good taste when composing responses in discussion forums, online collaboration and feedback tools, and other interactive spaces. Avoid profanity and other harsh comments. Minimize your use of slang, as it can be misinterpreted.    Avoid using all capital letters as it can be construed as “shouting” online, which can be perceived as aggressive behavior.    When using acronyms, make sure to clarify its meaning when you first use in your message.    Proofread your responses for accuracy and tone.        Campus Policies   Academic Integrity   What is Academic Integrity? Integrity is the College-wide expectation that students follow established guidelines and common knowledge to maintain ethical standards in their work.   Why does it matter? Integrity in academic matters is vital to all members of the College community. An academic integrity violation by a student devalues the accomplishments of other students, threatens the integrity of the College, and undermines the College's educational mission. During their time at FLC, students are expected to know, understand, and comply with the ethical standards of the College.   What is Academic Dishonesty? Academic dishonesty is defined as any form of unethical or illegal behavior regarding any academic work--with or without intent. These standards apply to all courses taken on or off campus, and all modes of course delivery.  Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, the following:    plagiarism,    cheating,    fabrication and falsification,    multiple submissions\/self-plagiarism,    misuse of academic materials,    unapproved and uncredited use of artificial intelligence,    and complicity in academic dishonesty.    See the full definition of academic dishonesty here: FLCs-Definition-of-Academic-Dishonesty.   If a faculty member alleges that you have committed an academic integrity violation, they will communicate with you and explain the alleged charges and then submit a report of academic dishonesty using this form: Report of Academic Dishonesty.   Faculty may use any legal and ethical method when identifying an academic integrity violation, including the use of plagiarism detection software and artificial intelligence detection software.   What are the consequences? In-class consequences for a charge can range from a reduced grade or zero on the assignment to a reduced grade or “F” in the course. College-wide consequences can range from academic intervention to suspension or expulsion.    Course Policy on use of Generative Artificial Intelligence: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT and other large language models can be extremely helpful as study aids and personalized tutors. You can use them to help explain complex topics or create additional practice problems. However, GAI use is forbidden on all exams in this class. Moreover, you are strongly discouraged from its use on homework; mastering and being able to explain material for yourself will lead to the greatest understanding.    Digital Accessibility  Fort Lewis College commits to ensuring that information technology and digital content it creates or distributes in its programs, services and activities is accessible to all individuals. The Policy on Accessibility of Information Technology and Digital Content reflects Fort Lewis College's commitment to providing access to information technology and digital content to all FLC students, employees and the general public.    Accessibility Resource Center  The Accessibility Resource Center provides inclusive, personalized, caring accommodations for students needing disability-related support. Students are encouraged to reach out to learn more and register for services.  Visit their website or email accessibilityresources@fortlewis.edu or call 970-247-7383.    Course Withdrawal Policy   The last day to withdraw from FLC classes with a grade of “CW” (course withdrawal) is Friday, October 31 at 4pm. This is a college-wide deadline that is not negotiable.  To withdraw from a course using a CW, fill out our online Withdrawal From Course Form at your Student Resource Center . You can also visit Skyhawk Station and pick up a Course Withdrawal form, and our staff will process the CW for you on the spot. This Course Withdrawal will not affect your financial aid for this term, and you will still owe the full amount for the class on your student bill. You should also be aware that dropping a course could affect your Pace Towards Graduation, impacting your eligibility for Financial Aid.      FLC Student Resources   Basic Needs Statement  The Grub Hub cares about your personal and academic success. We recognize that it can be hard to focus in class when you have trouble affording enough food to eat, do not have a safe and reliable place to sleep, and\/or experiencing an emergency or crisis. The Grub Hub offers several services for accessing basic needs. Join us for daily hot meals and a pantry full of free food, hygiene items, menstruation products, and more. We also offer financial assistance for housing insecurity and resource navigation for public benefits that students are eligible for, such as Medicaid and SNAP (a free federal food assistance program that can provide up to $250\/month for groceries). We are located in the Student Union, across from the Post Office, and open Monday-Friday, 10am-5pm. Contact Stella Zhu, the Basic Needs Coordinator (mzhu@fortlewis.edu), if you have questions or need assistance. The Grub Hub is here to support you.    Students as Parents Statement  We are aware that it can be challenging to be a parent while enrolled in college courses and we work to support parents to be successful in this work. If you are unable to attend class due to children's illnesses or unforeseen disruptions in childcare, please contact your instructor individually so we can make an alternate plan to help you meet the course outcomes. We are also happy to speak with you about some strategies that have helped parents in our courses to be successful in balancing home\/school responsibilities.    Reach out for Success  College students encounter setbacks from time to time. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it's important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor, academic advisor, peer support office, or counselor.
